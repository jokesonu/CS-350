# CS-350
Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  * The purpose of this project was to create a smart thermostat using the TI CC3200 board by implementing embedded software controls via GPIO, Timers, UART, and I2C to manage the board's LED and buttons and simulate transporting data. The goal was to allow the buttons to adjust the temperature set-point up or down, with a red LED indicating when the set-point is higher than the current temperature, simulating a heater turning on.
    
*	What did you do particularly well?
    * Problem solving – While I think I was able to figure out majority of what was needed for the course a couple of times I wasted a lot of time looking into problems like not finding one of the components being asked in the lesson. I was able to make a work around and as an example I couldn’t find the uartecho driver and instead used uart2echo. I was able to get it to work but later noticed it was mentioned about how to get around it after I had already found a workaround by tweaking the code.
    
*	Where could you improve?
    *	Time management – I ended up moving across country, accepting a new job at a new company, and got welcomed but unexpected news of a new addition to our family and it was rough balancing out the time needed to get through this course and navigating these new experiences. I’m typically good at juggling work life balance but this time it was a bit too much all at once. IN the end I was able to catch up on most of the work and think it would have been better for me to carve out dedicated scheduled times to work on the projects.
    
*	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    *	I am fortunately almost done with my studies for my BS in Computer Science and I think it’s imperative to keep motivation and time management as I near the end. I’m using more calendars and running my classes as a project manager might and sharing information with my wife to keep me accountable while also teaching her a thing or two.
    
*	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    *	The primary skill I believe I take away from this is problem solving skills. It took careful reading and attention to details to produce what was being asked of these projects.
    
*	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    *	I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable mostly by researching state machine documentation and using inline code to make it easier to make and track changes being made.
